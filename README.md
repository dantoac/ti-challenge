# Exercise Requirements

The `DataCapture` object accepts numbers and returns an object for querying statistics about the inputs. Specifically, the returned object supports querying how many numbers in the collection are less than a value, greater than a value, or within a range.

Hereâ€™s the program skeleton in Python to explain the structure: 


```python
capture = DataCapture()
capture.add(3)
capture.add(9)
capture.add(3)
capture.add(4)
capture.add(6)
stats = capture.build_stats()
stats.less(4) # should return 2 (only two values 3, 3 are less than 4) 
stats.between(3, 6) # should return 4 (3, 3, 4 and 6 are between 3 and 6)
stats.greater(4) # should return 2 (6 and 9 are the only two values greater than 4)
```

# Challenge conditions:
 - You cannot import a library that solves it instantly
 - The methods add(), less(), greater(), and between() should have
constant time O(1)
 - The method build_stats() can be at most linear O(n) o Apply the best practices you know1
 - Share a public repo with your project

# Execute
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pytest tests.py
```    

*Please use Python >= 3.8 for running this code*
